# Phishing-Simulation-Report
## Overview
This phishing simulation was conducted to assess employee vigilance, strengthen user-awareness, and evaluate the organization’s resilience against social-engineering threats. By using controlled, ethical phishing scenarios—including login-themed lures—employees were tested on their ability to recognize suspicious links, avoid credential entry, and properly report phishing attempts. The objective was not to penalize users, but to identify awareness gaps and reinforce secure behaviors.
## Objectives
- Measure user susceptibility to common phishing tactics
- Evaluate reactions to deceptive login prompts
- Track key security-awareness metrics
- Identify areas for targeted training
- Build a stronger, security-focused culture across the organization.
## Methodology
A crafted phishing scenario was distributed to selected users via email. The email included a simulated login prompt hosted in a secure testing environment. The simulation tracked:
- Link-click frequency
- Credential-submission attempts (with real passwords sanitized)
- Phishing-reporting rate
All testing was approved internally and aligned with ethical guidelines to ensure no actual harm or data exposure occurred.
## Key Metrics
- Link-click frequency decreased significantly, indicating improved caution when evaluating unexpected links.
- Credential-submission attempts dropped, showing stronger skepticism toward unfamiliar login prompts.
- Phishing-reporting rate increased, demonstrating more proactive and confident user responses.
These outcomes reflect meaningful progress toward employee cyber-resilience.
## Findings
The results indicate that employees are becoming more aware of phishing tactics and more capable of identifying suspicious activity. The reduction in risky actions—combined with an increased reporting rate—suggests successful knowledge retention from previous training efforts. However, some users still interacted with the phishing content, highlighting the continued need for reinforcement and periodic testing.
## Conclusion
The phishing simulation demonstrates positive progress in organizational awareness and behavior. Employees are showing greater caution, fewer risky interactions, and stronger reporting habits. Continued simulations and targeted training will reinforce this momentum, ensuring that human-factor risks remain minimized. Strengthening awareness today directly contributes to a more secure organization tomorrow.
